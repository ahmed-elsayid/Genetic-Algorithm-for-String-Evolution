# Genetic Algorithm for String Evolution

This project implements a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of strings towards a target string.

## Introduction

Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. In this project, the genetic algorithm is applied to evolve a population of strings towards a predefined target string.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

## Parameters

The genetic algorithm script allows customization through the following parameters:

- `population_size`: The size of the population. It determines how many individuals are in each generation.

- `mutation_rate`: The probability of a mutation occurring during reproduction. It influences the genetic diversity in the population.

- `target`: The target string that the population aims to evolve towards. This is the string your algorithm is trying to generate through evolution.

Adjust these parameters in the `main` function to experiment with different settings and observe their impact on the evolution process.

Example:

```python
# Example usage in main function
goal = "hello world"
main(population_size=1000, mutation_rate=0.1, target=goal)
